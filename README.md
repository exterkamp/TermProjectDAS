==============

This is my java based term project for CAP3027 - Digital Arts and Sciences

It is a behavioral simulation of bunnies eating a garden while trying to avoid a fox.

The features of this game are thus:
* Controlling actor bahavior with GUI elements
* Timed animations
* Dynamically modifying the playing area
* Pathfinding to find other actors
* Turning on and off seeing the paths actors take
