TermProjectDAS
==============

This is my java based term project for CAP3027 - Digital Arts and Sciences

It is a behavioral simulation of bunnies eating a garden while trying to avoid a fox.

The coding algorithms and techniques used in this project include:
* Pathfinding, including breadthfirst and eventually A*
* Timing, using java timers to control animations
